Ground Up Web App Project

## What is the Ground Up Server project?
The **Ground Up Web App Project ** is a personal project with a goal of building a production ready web app "from the ground up". The phrase "ground up" can also be interpreted, in this case, as making a service whole from different pieces, pieces that are ground up. 

Mostly a boilerplate to get some of my personal projects running without starting...from the ground up.
